## Inspiration
Video games have been an important source of relaxation in my adolescence. I always wanted to create even the simplest one of them and now i can proudly say that i did.
This program taught me that even the simplest projects require significant amount of time to be created. Another thing I learned was that bugs are inevitable in more complex video games.
